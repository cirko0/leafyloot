Welcome to the LeafyLoot frontend repository! Our frontend is an AI-generated, fully responsive, and functional website that's connected to the LeafyLoot backend for seamless integration.

## Overview

LeafyLoot's frontend is built using React with JavaScript and styled using the Tailwind CSS framework. The design was initially created in Figma and later transformed into code using AI technology. I've made further adjustments to ensure a fully functional and responsive website.

## Features

- **React with JavaScript**: Our frontend is powered by React, providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: I've used Tailwind CSS for easy and efficient styling.
- **AI-Generated Design**: The initial design was created in Figma and converted into code using AI technology.
- **Backend Integration**: Our frontend seamlessly integrates with the LeafyLoot backend, enabling data retrieval and interaction with the server.
